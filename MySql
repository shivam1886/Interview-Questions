 Aggregate Function
    To perform calculation on multiple rows of a single column. It retuns single value it is used to sysmmetric data
        1. count, 2. max, 3. min, 4.sum, 5.avg
     
   Difference Between
         Where and Having
               Where
                  -> where is used to filter rows
                  -> works on rows data, not aggregated data
                  -> select * from employees where salary > 50,000
               Having
                  -> works on aggregated data
                  -> select max(salary) as salary from employees having max(salary) > 50,000
         
         Union and Union ALl
               Union
                  -> Remove duplicate records
               
               Union All
                  -> Give also duplicate records
                  
               Notes* 
                 -> Union operator combine result set of two or more select statement
                 -> Each select statement must have
                     -> Same number of columns
                     -> Column must have similary data types
                     -> Column must be a same order
                     
                     
            In v/s Exists
                In
                  -> Multiple OR
                  ->select * from customers where city in (indore,bhopal,bangluru) or select * from customers where city in (select city from cites);
                  -> Big Outer query and small inner query
                Exist
                   -> Exist return TRUE or FALSE value
                   -> Small outer query and big inner query
                   -> select * from customers where city exist (select city from cites where city.city_id = customer.city)
            
            
           Order By / Group By
                 Order By
                    -> Sorting
                    -> default (Ascenging)
                    -> asc and desc
                    -> select * from salary order by salary desc
                 Group By
                    -> Group By used for aggregate function
                    -> select name  , count(is_active) from empoloyees group by is_active
                    
                    Notes*
                       -> Group by  follows where clause in select statements
                       -> where can not be used after group by 
                       -> Having is used after group by
                       
            Join v/s Subquery
                 Both are used to combine data from different tables witn a single data
                 Sub Query
                   -> can select only from first table
                   -> It is slower than join
                 
                 Join
                   -> Can select from either of the table
                   -> It is faster than sub-queries

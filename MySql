 Key
   Key is a set of one or more attritutes, which is used to uniquely identification row within a table.
   
   Types of keys
     Super key 
            Super key is a set of one or more attributes that uniquely identifies each record with in a table
            In super key attributes there must be a attributes which uniquely identifies the record. It can be extra attributes
            
     Condidate key 
           Candidate key is a minimal super key which contains no extra attributes. It consists of maximum possible attributes which is uniquely  identifies.
           candidate key is not null

     composite key
     Foreign Key
           A foreign are attributes in a table. whose value match as primary key in another table.
           Foreign key can be duplicate and also be NULL value
           FOreign key is used to integrity of the data
           
     secondary key
        
     
     
 
 Aggregate Function
    To perform calculation on multiple rows of a single column. It retuns single value it is used to sysmmetric data
        1. count, 2. max, 3. min, 4.sum, 5.avg
     
   Difference Between
         Where and Having
               Where
                  -> where is used to filter rows
                  -> works on rows data, not aggregated data
                  -> select * from employees where salary > 50,000
               Having
                  -> works on aggregated data
                  -> select max(salary) as salary from employees having max(salary) > 50,000
         
         Union and Union ALl
               Union
                  -> Remove duplicate records
               
               Union All
                  -> Give also duplicate records
                  
               Notes* 
                 -> Union operator combine result set of two or more select statement
                 -> Each select statement must have
                     -> Same number of columns
                     -> Column must have similary data types
                     -> Column must be a same order
                     
                     
            In v/s Exists
                In
                  -> Multiple OR
                  ->select * from customers where city in (indore,bhopal,bangluru) or select * from customers where city in (select city from cites);

           Order By / Group By
                 Order By
                    -> Sorting
                    -> default (Ascenging)
                    -> asc and desc
                    -> select * from salary order by salary desc
                 Group By
                    -> Group By used for aggregate function
                    -> select name  , count(is_active) from empoloyees group by is_active
                    
                    Notes*
                       -> Group by  follows where clause in select statements
                       -> where can not be used after group by 
                       -> Having is used after group by
                       
            Join v/s Subquery
                 Both are used to combine data from different tables witn a single data
                 Sub Query
                   -> can select only from first table
                   -> It is slower than join
                 
                 Join
                   -> Can select from either of the table

             Union Vs Join
                Union
                  -> Combine Rows
                  -> Not nessary to have same column name
                  -> But  no. of column & datatype of column should be same
                
                Join
                   -> Merge Column
                   -> Combine rows from two or more tables based on a related common column between them

         1. Using a tempary table
         2. using auto id
         3. using row_numbers()

              step 1  select distict * into temptable from oldtable

         2. Using auto id
              Delete from employees where auto_id not in (select min(auto_id) from employees group by emp_id,name) 
              
         3. Delete from (select * , row_number() over(partition by id order by id) as rn from mytable ) wheren rn > 1   
          
               
        Delete v/s Truncate / v/s
          Delete
            -> Comes under DML lanuage
            -> Delete removes some or all the rows or remoe specified row
            -> It does not free space containning the table
            -> The transaction log will still have the deleted rows
            -> rolled up
            -> slower
            -> DELETE FROM employees where id = 1;
           
            Truncate
              -> COmes under DDM language
              -> Delete all the rows

              -> no where clause
              -> can not be rolled up

          Different Between Char and varchar
             Char
               -> It store data with fixed length
               -> uses static memory allocation
               -> faster

               -> It store data with variable length
               -> It uses dynamic memory allocation
               -> better for storage space
               -> slower
               -> has an head of 2 bytes
          
          ON Delete Cascade vs On Delete Set Null
              On delete cascade
                 -> delete all the dependent rows from the child
              
              On Delete Set Null

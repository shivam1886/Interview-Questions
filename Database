    Types of database
      Structured Data
      Unstructured Data
      Semi-Structured Data
    
    Structured Data
      Structured data are those type of data which ara stored already in an order, There are neary 20% of the total existing data are structured data.
      All the generated from sensors,webblogs,there are all machine generated structured data. the human generated structured data are those which are taken 
      as information from a human. Like their names,dob etc.
      Example if structured data is database.
    
    Unstructured Data
      The Unstructured data have no clear format in storage. We can store structured data in row-column database. But unstructured data can not be store like that.
      At lest 80% of data are unstructured. All satelite-generated images,sceintific data or images are categorized as machine-generated unstructured data.
      There  are varius types of human-generated unstructured data. These are iamges, videos,social media data etc.
      The example of unstructured data are text documents, pdfs images and vides etc.

      It is very difficult  to categorize the type of data. Sometimes they look structured or sometimes unstructured. So that's why these data are known as semi-structured
      data. We can not store these type of data using tradional databasde format, But it contains some organizetional  properties.
      The example of semi-structured data are spread sheet files, XML or json documents, NoSQL database items etc.
